# SQL Schema Models

Stand-alone SQL models to enhance larger data models.


## Date Dimensions

Almost all data models can be improved by adding a calendar table which has dates over a range with useful info and such, such as weekday names.

This model extends this by including holidays and additional columns.


## Geography

Countries and cities.


## Loans

Simple loan and customer tables.
